# Double Elimination Tournament in Ruby

This code implements a double elimination bracket tournament in Ruby. I am designing it specifically for my music tournament that I plan on running, but I suppose it could be adapted to other use cases. I'm writing it in Ruby to practice, since I'm teaching Ruby this semester.
